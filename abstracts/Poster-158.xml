  <h2 xmlns="">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p xmlns="">In an article, published in 1981, the British theatre scholars C.M. Fogarty and Thomas Lawrenson wrote that the “reconstruction is perhaps the approach in theatre scholarship which comes closest to seizing the essence of the art of theatre."<cite href="#n1">1</cite> Fogarty and Lawrenson referred to reconstructions of historical performances. However, in my poster presentation I will present a different kind of reconstruction: <em>virtual</em> reconstructions of early modern theatre buildings. More specifically, I intend to illustrate how computer models can help theatre and literature historians to better understand and present the vanished theatrical heritage of the Low Countries (present-day Belgium and the Netherlands).</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">2. Background</h2>
  <p xmlns="">Computer modelling and virtual reconstructions are not new. Since John Golder’s experimental reconstruction of the seventeenth-century Théâtre du Marais (Paris),<cite href="#n2">2</cite> a handful of theatre scholars have, with the help of the computer, reconstructed and visualized historical theatres, with much attention going to early modern (1500-1800) theatres <cite href="#n3">3</cite>. Nevertheless, despite the advances in computer
modelling and despite 3D modelling software becoming more accessible, such an
approach has not been attempted for the early modern theatre history in the Low
Countries, even though the approach has a number of potential advantages.</p>
  <p xmlns="">The Low Countries
have a rich and dynamic early modern theatre history, including many amateur
theatre societies, Chambers of Rhetoric, court theatres, and commercial
theatres. Furthermore, the rise and fall of certain theatre evolutions is
strongly linked to the tumultuous economic evolutions of the region’s cities.
Theatre buildings are an externalization of both these theatrical and
economic/urban evolutions. Nevertheless, present-day theatre historiography
tells us very little about what these theatre buildings looked like. The
economic decline and the lack of world-renowned playwrights have played a role
in that, but the lack of (easy to interpret) iconographic evidence is at least
as problematic. Often only a combination of information from indirect archival
sources, the plays written for these theatres, and ambiguous iconographic
material, will tell us more about these places of theatrical performance.
Computer models are excellent receptacles for this information, for testing
hypotheses and even for studying rejected designs.</p>
  <p xmlns="">The poster
presentation will be based on the experiences and results of ongoing research
at the University of Antwerp (Literature Department). Part of this research
initially focused on creating models of the early modern theatres of Antwerp.
Later the research was expanded to include theatres from Ghent (Belgium) and
Amsterdam (the Netherlands). So far fourteen theatres or locations of
theatrical performances have been reconstructed. I will illustrate my poster
with a number of images of these models.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">3. Aspects</h2>
  <p xmlns="">The poster presentation will include information on the following aspects:</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li><strong>Methodology &amp; data:</strong>What sources are
available (i.e. what data/input do we have)? What can these sources tell us
(i.e. what value does the data have)? What software could be used?</li>
    <li><strong>Output: </strong>
What types of reconstructions can be used, i.e. what
can these virtual models look like? I will show both more realistic and
visually attractive textured reconstructions on the one hand (fig.1), and more
abstract and less hypothetical grey-scale isometric images on the other
(fig.2).
</li>
    <li><strong>Advantages: </strong>
I wish to address some of the advantages of computer
modelling in the field of the theatre history of the Low Countries. For
example: virtual reconstructions allow us to show what is lost (both to
academic peers and to a general audience); they facilitate any discussion of
the theatres; they are “sophisticated tools in primary research—the historians’
usual labor of unravelling what the sources do and do not reveal about a
performance”;<cite href="#n4">4</cite> the models help students to dive right into the theatrical heritage, etc.<cite href="#n5">5</cite></li>
    <li><strong>Next steps:</strong>
I wish to list a number of potential next steps. These include the creation of a database with standardized, comparable
models. But also the reconstruction of less obvious theatrical buildings (e.g.
a twentieth-century Dutch synagogue which was later transformed into a
community centre/theatre).
