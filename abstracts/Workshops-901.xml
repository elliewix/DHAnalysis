  <h2 xmlns="">Summary:
</h2>
  <p xmlns="">Web archiving is an important part of the digital preservation field. While most are
familiar with the Wayback Machine available at archive.org, less are aware that
there are a number of tools and services developed for organizations and
individuals to create their own web archives, including the capability to search and
analyze large data sets built around the WARC file format, an ISO standard for web
archiving. In addition, web archives provide permanent URLs for citation and can
show how a website has changed over time at a single URL, even if no longer
available on the live web. In short, web archives can save a researcher’s life and
provide very necessary preservation tools for archivists to manage content that is
only posted on the web.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">This workshop will introduce participants (15-20) to basic web archiving concepts
and challenges. Using the Archive-It (www.archive-it.org) web application,
participants will have a hands-on opportunity to build a collection of content
archived from the web, which can include their own organization’s web presence,
social media, digital exhibitions, data sets, or topical content publicly available on
the web. Following the workshop participants will have a searchable archive
available to them, including the option of downloading WARC files for long term
preservation or research.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">The target audience for this workshop includes interested humanities scholars
researching the web and professionals responsible for digital library service or digital archives. No prerequisite knowledge of or experience with web archives is
necessary, and the session does not require any programming or advanced technical
knowledge of the web. The workshop will not be oriented towards those with deep
knowledge of web archives or the WARC format, although there could be time
allotted to a demonstration of another web archiving tool or project related to
digital humanities and web archiving and this should be specified in the CFP (see
below). </p>
  <h2 xmlns="">CFP:
</h2>
  <p xmlns="">In order to make the most of the 3 hour workshop and ensure that the curriculum is
tailored toward participant interest, a CFP will be requested for all interested
persons. It should include:
</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li>Description of participant research interest or professional projects.</li>
    <li>Description of prior experience with using web archives or their own web
archiving (if applicable).</li>
    <li>5 to 10 websites to be archived as part of 1 or more collections of content, and links
to the Robots.txt files if applicable. More information is here:
https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/ARIH/Robots+Exclusion+Protocol#RobotsExclusionProtocol-Whatistherobotsexclusionprotocol?
</li>
  </ul>
  <p xmlns="">With permission from participants, URLs will be crawled as a test (no data archived)
prior to the workshop so post crawl reports can be analyzed as part of the workshop
curriculum.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">The CFP process is not intended for competitive review but to ensure relevancy and
preparedness of participants. It should be received at least 2 weeks before the
workshop. CFPs will be reviewed by the instructor and Kristine Hannah, Director of
Web Archiving Services at the Internet Archive.
</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Cost and Equipment Required:
</h2>
  <p xmlns="">There will be no additional costs associated with the workshop. It will require a
meeting room with wireless internet and a projector with screen. Participants will
bring their own wi-fi enabled laptop computers and there should be sufficient
power outlets.
