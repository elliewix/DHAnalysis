This pre-conference workshop aims to bring together leading scholars involved in major digital scholarly infrastructure projects such as DARIAH, NeDiMAH, Europeana Cloud, ARIADNE, 3D ICONS, EHRI, DASISH, LARM, CLARIN, DiRT and DHCommons, in dialogue with practising digital humanists. Topics to be addressed include cultural heritage and digital media infrastructures, tools and services; the creation and curation of humanities digital resources; social and institutional issues of Digital Humanities infrastructures; and finally, lessons learnt from the role of digital humanities in pedagogy and academic curricula. It will provide an opportunity for humanists to find out about cutting edge developments on major digital infrastructure initiatives in Europe and beyond, and to make their views matter on future developments in this field.The workshop aims to go beyond a description of project presentations. It will seek to provide an analytical framework that could contribute to a critical understanding of the current state of digital infrastructures vis-à-vis the potential of digital archives, tools and services for humanities scholarship, by addressing the following questions:The workshop will be led by the following international team:The workshop will be of direct relevance to the conference topic of Digital Cultural Empowerment, as it aims to take stock and review critically the current state of play, and potential future developments, on digital   make the voice of humanists heard on the subject of digital infrastructures for the arts and humanities, a potentially important empowering factor concerning digital humanities research. It is expected to be of interest both to those involved in digital research infrastructure work, and to digital humanists who may benefit from the use and contribute to shaping the plans for future developments of digital infrastructures, tools and services.The event will involve formal presentations by the organisers, and speakers who are developers and evaluators of current and future digital cultural heritage infrastructures. The workshop organizers will provide summarized critical reviews to accepted submissions, and speakers will address generic leading questions from the organizers, and moderated dialogue with digital humanists present, so that we can provide meaningful experience to the participants. We hope that this format will allow participants to discuss and understand where mistakes are made and how to evaluate and redesign and improve their own infrastructures.CFP: The CFP will be published one week after workshop acceptance, and authors will have 4 weeks for submission and will receive replies within two weeks of submission deadline.Speakers in the workshop will be selected from a call, addressed to partners of major digital infrastructures in the arts and humanities. The program committee consists of the workshop leaders: Dr Agiatis Benardou, Professor Erik Champion, Professor Lorna Hughes, and Sally Chambers.In 2013 we ran a workshop on the subject of Cultural Heritage Creative Tools and Archives (http://chcta.wordpress.com), funded by the European Alliance of Digital Humanities, NeDiMAH, DIGHUMLAB, and the National Museum of Copenhagen (where it was hosted). The countries represented at this event included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Romania, United Kingdom, and Canada. We were particularly pleased to have two invited speakers at this workshop who each have many decades of experience in cultural heritage infrastructures: Professor Julian Richards of York University, and Professor Sean Ross, Dean of the iSchool, University of Toronto. From the two days of presentations we saw several issues reappearing in many of the presentations. Many EU institutes were duplicating (without realising) the work of others; there was little systematic evaluation of user needs (although several papers were exceptionally useful surveys of user needs before and after); and the lessons learnt from comparing the original aims and objectives with the final or posited audience needs were not always consistently followed through.For a half day, 3 hours plus breaks.Total: 180 minutes; we will invite speakers to a restaurant dinner at own expense after the workshop.Target audience: Digital humanists at large, including also archaeologists, heritage experts and historians, archivists, and those interested in cultural heritage infrastructures at European level. The 2013 CHCTA workshop had roughly 20 presentations and 40 in total attended.Expected speakers: 8Expected audience number: 30
