  <p xmlns="">Collective Biographies of Women, is an open-access project supported by the
Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, Scholars’ Lab, and the English
Department at the University of Virginia, as well as an ACLS Digital Innovation
Fellowship. In recent years it has grown from an online bibliography of all English-
language books that collect three or more short biographies of women into a digital
prosopography that interrelates women, printed books, and narratives in what we call
documentary social networks (introduced at DH 2013). CBW stands out as a literary
study of prosopographies in the print era, and primarily the transatlantic nineteenth
century (see the bibliography, http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu). Most research that
employs the term <em>prosopography</em> allies itself with history or classical and medieval
studies, and today, relies on databases and websites. We work with the concept as it is
often defined, as collective biography, that is, printed prose collections of short
biographies (see the selective bibliography for a context on prosopography, nonfiction
narrative, and our method of mid-range reading).
</p>
  <p xmlns="">The CBW database associates some 8700 persons, 13,000 chapters (biographies),
and more than 1200 books of various types published in English 1830-1940 (see
developing database at http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/cbw_db). Our project, however, is
neither a textual archive nor a biographical database but an experiment in interpretation
using the tools of DH to recognize the conventions of a genre, biography, and the history
of gender conventions in a certain social context. Specifically, we want to get at the
conditions of nonfiction, which generate multiple versions and cut and paste with
relatively little respect for authorship. Could narrative theory of nonfiction be developed
through a technique of digital markup that allows us to compare multiple versions of one
life and interrelated types of person and text? With Daniel Pitti, Suzanne Keen,
postdoctoral Project Manager Rennie Mapp, and teams of graduate assistants, we have
developed and deployed a stand-aside XML schema, Biographical Elements and
Structure Schema (BESS), in sample archives of digitized collective biographies that
include designated individuals (e.g. all collections in our bibliography that include
Caroline Herschel, the astronomer).
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Briefly, BESS is an XML schema with a controlled vocabulary for narrative
elements that appear in a given text:
</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li>
      <strong>StageofLife: <em>before, beginning, middle, culmination, end, after,</em></strong>
      <em> relative to the
              lifetimeofthebiography’ssubject</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>EventType<em> e.g. illness, persona’s</em></strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AgentType<em> e.g. mother, unnamed</em></strong>
        </li>

          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Structure, <em>e.g. school</em></strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> Dates, TimeofDay, Season

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>PersonaDescription<em> e.g. physically daring</em></strong>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Topos: <em>e.g. influence, disgrace</em></strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p xmlns="">Each editor in a trained team creates a separate XML file that in effect is an annotated
outline, tagging types of elements identified in numbered paragraphs of a TEI file of the
biographical narrative (from 3-100+ paragraphs).

					BESS analysis enables us to compare versions of the same person’s life. When we have
analyzed all versions in our corpus, we give unique ID numbers to the essential events in
all versions (kernels) and the more or less common optional events (satellites, common or
rare), and can compare the placement of these in the versions, much as folklorists have
charted the variations on the main events of a tale. (Narrative theorists have developed
analyses of events in these terms, but not for nonfiction.) BESS analysis reveals
differences in narrative technique in books that take different perspectives on women’s
roles and that select persons of different types. Thus, beyond the literal level of actions
(events), we can measurably correlate, for example, the instances of <em>direct address, use of
‘we’</em> alongside not only the topos (i.e. situation; underlying scenario) <em>work as social
service</em> but also the topos <em>temptation of status or goods</em>. The conjunction of different
elements in these biographies often challenges our own later assumptions about historical
women and gender norms. As BESS work is completed, we expand a body of data that
for the first time documents the distinctive characteristics of third-person narratives about
real people.</p>

  <p xmlns="">Currently working with a web designer, we have a sustainable, accessible
database that functions well for team workflow, with parallel display of text and BESS
analyses. We plan to develop the visualizations of BESS beyond current designs of
tables and graphs. </p>

  <p xmlns="">The CBW project’s BESS “reading” of many narratives is time-consuming and detailed,
as in many literary digital projects. As in all DH, we encounter challenges when
visualizing quantities of variable data, an issue that this paper merely touches upon. Our
aim, instead, is to introduce and make a case for the mid-range approach of BESS, with
some reference to other possible approaches.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Many methods of text “reading” en masse might be useful with the CBW books.
Broadly, options range from word strings and topic clusters across a large corpus of
digitized texts to systematic encoding of all textual features and variants in an onlineß
edition of an archive (e.g. Online Froissart; the Rossetti Archive). On the vast end of the
scale, we recognize the astounding range of a Google N-gram kind of data capture as well
as the precision of some text-mining projects. On the closer focus of the scale, we think
human curation is best suited for patterns of narration and ideology, and we begin with
books and place them in a context of genre and publishing history. Thus we try to benefit
from the precedents of literary editions, and yet CBW is not a project in textual editing.
We have no wish to fine-tune exact digital surrogates of these books. The BESS schema
and approach to many-versioned biographies within social and historical contexts is
designed to moderate between distant and close reading—a comprehensive digital model
of variations within a genre and fine textual details.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Many in DH have addressed the question of what to do with a million books.
Franco Moretti has espoused distant reading, a term applicable to many kinds of directed
and unsupervised queries in big archives. This is understood as opposed to "close
reading," the usual literary method (without computational mediation), one text, one
person. The findings of singular textual analysis are less appropriate when describing
patterns across a genre, especially of nonfiction where there are many versions of the
“same” narrative and the author is less important than the protagonist, the representation
of a real person. Thus, our method has some affinity for Sharon Marcus and Stephen
Best’s concept of “surface reading,” as advocated in their manifesto to put a stop to the
required "critique" or theoretical digging into a text for what it does not say for
ideological purposes. Yet we retain a framing conceptual commitment to ideological
critique, as we want to know about the changing gender ideology and historical contexts
for women’s lives. More directly, we are pursuing the kind of "social reading" promoted
by Alan Liu, as we hope to extend BESS as a tool available for other projects in digital
interpretation of biographical narratives. BESS, interlinked with a database that reveals
networks among historical persons and books about them, recruits computation to
aggregate the interpretations of readers to parse a genre.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">We call for a new metaphor or spatial model for hybrid methods of mid-range
digital interpretation, whether using a stand-aside markup like BESS or other approaches.
Our editing teams “hover," not at satellite level, but like balloon aerial digital cameras
scanning a neighborhood, producing images that can zoom in and out. Such records do
much less harm to the person, the individual record, than surveillance or drones. Our
schema functions, alternatively, like GPR, "ground-penetrating radar," used to detect
buried structures two or three feet into the ground. Although such metaphors for our
mid-range reading method with BESS have the inherent comedy of balloons and robot-
like go-carts, we can seriously enhance what we know above or beneath the surface
without destroying it—without murdering to dissect. I remind the BESS team that the
texts are always still awaiting any method of interpretation, unmangled after we have
subjected them to our skewed adaptation for prosopographical purposes. We’re not
pretending to let machines discover without distortion. Nor are we clinging to the
requirement that reading is an individual act—on the contrary. Like reading, biographies
trope toward the collective and typological, the mid-range, even in monographic form.
Inviting open-access play, we expect to be surprised by the details in the mosaic or wave-
like picture from above or below.
