  <p xmlns="">This project uses Neatline and
Gephi to demonstrate how digital visualization tools can bring to light new
dimensions of modernist studies and periodical studies. Drawing on metadata
from as-yet-undigitized letters between various Canadian writers and editors, the
project uses geospatial visualizations and network diagrams to interrogate the
literary networks and geographical patterning of authors associated with the little
magazine <em>Contemporary Verse</em>. In
addition to the printed poster, I will have a laptop running Neatline and Gephi,
which will allow attendees to interact with the data by exploring it through
maps, timelines and network diagrams.</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Contemporary
Verse</em>ran from 1941-1953 and was one of the only vehicles for the
publication of modern poetry in mid-century Canada. It was edited by Alan
Crawley (1887-1975), whose voluminous correspondence – lodged in various
archives across Canada – is an enormously rich resource for the study of the social
networks through which poetic currents and aesthetic influences developed. To
read it is to get a clear sense of the importance of Crawley in brokering
relationships between writers and publishers, shaping the poems that
contributors submitted to the journal, and encouraging young writers –
particularly younger women who faced considerable difficulties breaking into male-dominated
networks for publication and critique – to see their poetry as something worth pursuing.<cite href="#n1">1</cite> </p>
  <p xmlns="">The letters tell an important story
of pre-digital cultural empowerment that digital humanities approaches are
particularly well suited to uncovering, given that the volume of correspondence
lends itself to the kind of distant reading that is made possible by
computational analysis of prosopographical and geographical metadata. The new perspectives
opened up on this archival material by digital methods are also timely, as scholars
of Canadian literature are increasingly engaged in challenging canonical
accounts of modernism’s development within the country,<cite href="#n2">2</cite> something which has
coincided with a postcolonial turn of sorts within digital humanities more
generally.<cite href="#n3">3</cite></p>
  <p xmlns="">The poster, which reports on work
in progress into the Crawley letters, is focused around two research questions:</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">1) How does geography inflect the development of modern poetry in Canada?</h2>
  <p xmlns="">Each letter was
entered as a record in Omeka and then visualized geospatially using Neatline (<a href="http://www.modmaps.net/mm/neatline/show/crawley-letters">www.modmaps.net/mm/neatline/show/crawley-letters</a>).
Neatline was configured so that as the timeline slider was moved from earlier
to later dates, the map display showed the growth and geographical distribution
of Crawley’s network of correspondents. Displaying the correspondence in this
way enables investigation of spatial questions that arise at a range of scales
from the national to the local, for example the extent to which Crawley’s
location on the west coast was able to challenge the dominance of literary
networks in the eastern cities of Montreal and Toronto, and the effect of
Vancouver’s geography on his ability to participate in literary activities. </p>
  <h2 xmlns="">2) What is the relationship between literary networks and cultural production?</h2>
  <p xmlns="">Gephi was used to
create a directed graph with 25 nodes, representing Crawley, various authors
with whom he corresponded, other journal editors, and the women who did the bulk
of the administrative work for <em>Contemporary
Verse</em>. As with the Neatline map, the network diagrams generated by Gephi do
not give a complete picture of Crawley’s network of correspondents as archival
work is still ongoing, but nonetheless some preliminary suggestive patterns
emerge. Crawley’s initial correspondents are more likely to be women, for
instance, but as the journal accrues prestige, more established poets become
interested in submitting to it, and these poets were more likely to be men.
Such a narrative is clearly open to critique – for example it raises methodological
questions about which letters were included – but this is a valuable process
for raising questions about the partiality of the “data” on which existing
narratives about the development of Canadian modernism have relied. </p>
  <p xmlns="">This project forms part of <strong>EMiC: Editing Modernism in Canada</strong> (<a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/">editingmodernism.ca</a>).
It is also being developed in association with <strong>TCLL: Twentieth Century Literary Letters</strong> (<a href="http://www.modmaps.net/tcllp/">www.modmaps.net/tcllp</a>),
a collaborative project in its early stages which aims to build a digital
infrastructure for the discovery, analysis, and visualization of the metadata
from a wide range of epistolary materials relating to twentieth century
literary figures. As a founding member of TCLL,
I am keen to find other scholars working on letter collections who would be
interested in joining the project, and one of the aims of showcasing this work at
DH2014 is to make connections with others whose metadata could be productively brought
into conversation with existing TCLL materials.</p>
