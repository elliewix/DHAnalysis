  <h2 xmlns="">Context</h2>
  <p xmlns="">Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org) is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital
texts. Users can create their own corpus of texts to work with by pointing to URLs or
uploading files in a variety of formats (plain text, XML, HTML, PDF, MS Word, RTF, etc.).
Voyant allows users to navigate between macro views of the corpus (e.g. a word cloud
visualization of the entire corpus) and micro views (e.g. a reading individual occurrences of a
specific term in context). The default interface provides access to eight tools for reading texts
and studying frequency and distribution data, and many more tools are available in various
pre-defined or user-defined "skins" (a layout of tools that interact).</p>
  <p xmlns="">Using the hosted version of Voyant has several advantages. For instance, Voyant can be
accessed immediately through most modern browsers and no software installation or
configuration is required (some of the tools need plugins for Flash or Java, but not the ones in
the default skin). Similarly, users are always accessing the most recent stable version of the
web application, no actions are required by the user to update the software (typically, new
builds with bug fixes and new functionality are released several times a month). A third benefit
relates to Voyant's design as a networked tool where users can generate persistent URLs for
their corpus and tools that can be stored, shared and embedded in remote sites.</p>
  <p xmlns="">The accessibility and convenience of the hosted version of Voyant also has disadvantages,
however. Users often tell us they are wary of uploading texts to a server out of concern for
possible copyright infringement or privacy issues. Consistent with its overall design priority of
keeping things simple, Voyant does not currently have any user or access management
system, so technically any uploaded content could be accessed by anyone (in practice, each
uploaded corpus has a generated ID that it would be extremely unlikely to guess – so corpora
are as hidden as users choose them to be). Still, with some material (protected responses to
a survey that has required ethics approval, for instance), uploading content to a public, non-secure (non-SSL) site is not an acceptable option. A second potential source of
frustration with the hosted version of Voyant is performance, especially with larger-scale text
collections. The hosted server is configured to timeout after about 30 seconds, which can be
insufficient when uploading, pre-processing and indexing a large text collection (the issue in
some cases is not so much the scalability of Voyant as an application, but the constraints of a
web application configured to support multiple concurrent users). Performance can also be an
issue when running a workshop or tutorial with Voyant: 30 users hitting the same button at
once can overwhelm the server (the current hosted deployment of Voyant runs in a
ComputeCanada High Performance Computing facility but does not run as a cloud service
that could smoothly expand capacity as on-demand). A final disadvantage with the hosted
version of Voyant is that it requires reliable internet connectivity, which may be a mere
nuisance at 30,000 feet, but a true problem at, say, a conference workshop with slow or
unstable wireless. Performance, privacy, connectivity: three reasons among others to explore
alternatives to using the hosted version of Voyant.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Workshop Outline</h2>
  <p xmlns="">
    <strong>1) What is Voyant? (1 hour)</strong>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="">We will begin with a general introduction to Voyant within the broader landscape of
digital text analysis. We will provide context and resources for working with digital
texts. We will provide a brief overview of Voyant's user interface and discussion its
strengths and weaknesses. We will suggest some other tools and techniques that may
be of interest to workshop participants. This component of the workshop is like a
mini-workshop on Voyant that will ensure a common base of familiarity with text
analysis in general and Voyant in particular.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">
    <strong>2) My Voyant (1 hour)</strong>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="">We will summarize some of the pros and cons of working with the hosted version of
Voyant compared to running a local, stand-alone version. We will describe how to
acquire a version of Voyant that can be run locally and then guide participants through
running Voyant as a simple click-and-run desktop-style application. We will point out
some of the most important technical aspects to be aware of, including how to
understand the versioning system, where to find locally stored corpora, and how to
respond to common errors.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">
    <strong>3) Tweaking My Voyant (1 hour)</strong>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="">The nature of a web-application will be deliberately underemphasized in the previous
component in favour of presenting My Voyant as a simple desktop-style application.
This third component of the workshop will revisit the nature of My Voyant and explore
ways that the web application can be tweaked to improve performance (memory settings in Java, server timeout settings, etc.) or otherwise fine-tuned (such as
changing the default server port). The content will still be oriented around what's most
relevant for a typical user of Voyant (not, say, a unix system administration guru).
Finally, we will describe some strategies for deploying multiple instances of My Voyant
for teaching/training purposes.</p>
  <p xmlns="">In most cases the hosted version of Voyant is probably still best in terms of convenience and
sharing of work, but there are times where a local instance of Voyant may be preferable,
especially with respect to performance, privacy and off-line access. This workshop, focused
on using (not managing) My Voyant locally, will serve to expand the possibilities of doing
digital text analysis.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Workshop Leaders:</h2>
  <p xmlns=""><strong>Stéfan Sinclair</strong>, sgsinclair@gmail.com, is an Associate Professor in Digital
Humanities at McGill University. His research focuses primarily on the design,
development and theorization of tools for the digital humanities, especially for text
analysis and visualization. He has led or contributed significantly to projects such as
Voyant Tools, the Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR), and BonPatron. Other
professional activities include serving as associate editor of Digital Humanities
Quarterly, as well as serving on the executive boards of CSDH/SCHN, ACH, ADHO,
and centerNET.</p>
  <p xmlns=""><strong>Geoffrey Rockwell</strong>, grockwel@ualberta.ca, is a Professor of Philosophy and
Humanities Computing at the University of Alberta, Canada. He has published and
presented papers in the area of philosophical dialogue, textual visualization and
analysis, humanities computing, instructional technology, computer games and
multimedia. He was the project leader for the CFI (Canada Foundation for Innovation)
funded project TAPoR, a Text Analysis Portal for Research, which has developed a
text tool portal for researchers who work with electronic texts. He is the author of
"Defining Dialogue: From Socrates to the Internet with Humanity Books."
</p>
  <p xmlns=""><strong>Target Audience</strong>: a wide range of DH practitioners interested in text analysis, particularly
for research, teaching, or technical support. Voyant Tools workshops are typically
fully-subscribed; we prefer to limit registration to about 30 people to allow us to help
participants as needed.
