  <p xmlns="">What can your computer habits reveal about you?  The answer might surprise you.  Previous work (Juola, et al., 2013) has shown that just a few
minutes of computer usage can be used to identify who is at the keyboard and
their demographic and psychological attributes with a fairly high degree of
accuracy.  We expand upon this to show
that the same usage data can be used to thoroughly profile a previously-unknown
user to obtain valuable psychological information about the user.</p>
  <p xmlns="">

Authorship attribution, the analysis of a document’s writing
style to infer the author’s identity, is a well-established problem in text
classification.  Previously, we used
classical authorship attribution techniques to identify “who was at the
keyboard” using the DARPA Active Authentication Corpus (Juola et al, 2013).  Researchers have successfully applied the
analysis of language usage to infer authorship of written documents (Juola,
2006. Koppel et al, 2009. Stamatatos,
2009. Jockers &amp; Witten, 2010), and stylometric analysis has also been
applied to things like gender (Argamon et al, 2006), personality (Luyckx &amp; Daelemans, 2008),
and even psychological disorders like depression (Rude et al, 2004).</p>
  <p xmlns="">Here, we attempt to perform the same technique with groups
composed of individuals who share common psychological traits.  Previous work (Luyckx &amp;
Daelemans, 2008. Noecker &amp; Juola, 2013) on personality profiling has so far
focused on analyzing previously-written documents.  In contrast, our system provides a method for
real-time psychological profiling of a user based on his or her interactions
with a computer over a relatively short period of time (approximately 30
minutes).  The ultimate goal is two-fold:
to learn something about a previously-unobserved user (traditional stylometric
identification techniques require us to have training data on a user before we
can identify him) and to use psychological traits as an enhancement to current
user authentication methods.</p>
  <p xmlns="">Currently, exact accuracy on the user-based authentication
is approximately 90%.  This task becomes
more difficult (and the accuracy becomes correspondingly lower) as the pool of
potential author models grows.  In order
to improve overall accuracy of the user authentication task, we propose to
include these psychological profiling tools in the authentication system.  If a given user can be identified as the most
likely candidate with 90% probability, and several facets of that user’s
personality can be confirmed with similarly high confidence, this will increase
the overall robustness of the authentication system.</p>
  <p xmlns="">For our purposes, we used two personality/intelligence
measurement systems to profile users: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Multiple
Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS).</p>
  <p xmlns="">The Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI) assigns four binary
classifications to define personality (Myers &amp; Myers, 1980)

</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li>Extroversion
     vs Introversion</li>
    <li>iNtuition

    <li>Thinking

    <li>Judgement
     vs Perception</li>
  </ul>
  <p xmlns="">
The Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales
(MIDAS) were developed by Dr. Howard Gardner in his 1983 book “Frames of Mind”
(Gardner, 1983).  He used a unique
definition of intelligence: “The ability to solve a problem or create a product
that is valued within one or more cultures” (MI Research and
Consulting).  He identified 8 primary
intelligent scales, each of which have several subscales (MI
Research and Consulting):

    <strong>Materials and Methods</strong>
  </h2>
  <h2 xmlns="">Corpus</h2>
  <p xmlns="">

 
In order to create the most accurate corpus possible, we set
up a simulated office environment and hired 80 temporary workers for one week
each.  Workers were tasked to perform a
long-term blogging project (research and write blog articles on topics “related
to Pittsburgh in some way”) over the course of a normal workweek.  For this study, we use the Free Key Logger
output, which provides the exact text typed by each user.  We do not include any information about the
applications being used or any data the user pastes from the clipboard.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Feature Extraction</h2>
  <p xmlns="">

For our analysis, we used the Java Graphical Authorship
Attribution Program (JGAAP) (Juola et al, 2009).  JGAAP is a
Java-based, modular program for textual analysis, text categorization, and
authorship attribution.  It provides a
comprehensive framework, allowing us to rapidly test the effectiveness of
different analysis techniques on the recorded data.</p>
  <p xmlns="">JGAAP divides analysis into several steps: Canonicization
(Preprocessing), Event Set (Feature) Generation, and Analysis.  In Canonicization, preprocessors are used to
standardize the text.  For this step, we
converted all input letters to lower case (“Unify Case”) and converted all
strings of whitespace characters into a single space character (“Normalize
Whitespace”).  At this stage, we also
processed a variety of special keyboard characters, converting these
non-printable characters into a printable placeholder (e.g. “backspace” was
replaced with “β”). 
Finally, we divided the input data into blocks of 1,000 characters, representing
about 30 minutes of computer usage.</p>
  <p xmlns="">For the event set generation, we tested character N-grams
for all N from 1 to 15, and word N-grams for N from 1 to 5.  We then applied a number of analysis methods
for each experiment: Cosine Distance, Intersection Distance, Manhattan
Distance, and Matusita Distance.  For
each method, we used a centroid-based nearest neighbor classifier.  We performed leave-one-out cross-validation
to reach our final conclusion.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Models</h2>
  <p xmlns="">For the MBTI classifiers, we built four binary classifiers
(i.e. E vs I, N vs S, T vs F, and J vs P). 
For the MIDAS classifiers, we first built a single 9-way classifier to
identify a user’s principle main scale.  This
was the scale along which the user scored highest (i.e. the scale for which the
user showed the highest preference).  For
example, a user might have a preference for “Musical” or “Linguistic”.  We also developed subscale classifiers, which
identify a user’s preference within each major scale.  For instance, a user might be identified as
“(Musical) Vocal Ability” and “(Kinesthetic) Dexterity”, etc.  Thus, each user was identified by a single
main scale preference as well as nine subscale preferences.

 

</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">
    <strong>Results</strong>
  </h2>
  <h2 xmlns="">MBTI</h2>
  <p xmlns="">For the MBTI classifiers, we averaged an accuracy of
81.5%.  The expected baseline average
(assuming we pick the most prevalent personality type for each category) is
55%. </p>
  <h2 xmlns="">MIDAS</h2>
  <p xmlns="">For the MIDAS main category identification, our best
performing classifier had accuracy of 70.7%. 
This was using character 15 grams with Intersection Distance.  The expected baseline accuracy (achieved by
choosing the most common main scale, “Linguistic”) was 22.1%.</p>
  <p xmlns="">For the MIDAS subscale identification, the best performing
classifiers used a variety of Character n-grams, again with Intersection
Distance as the top performing analysis method. 
The average subscale accuracy was 81%.</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  </h2>
  <p xmlns="">We have shown here a method to reliably psychologically
profile a computer user based on only a short period (about 30 minutes) of
usage time.  In addition to providing
valuable information about the user in question, this method can also be used
to provide additional layers of security for the active authentication system
we have described previously.  Even in an
adversarial situation, the difficulty of imitating both an individual user’s
style, as well as mimicking the psychological profile of the user, will provide
additional security to the authentication system.</p>
  <p xmlns="">Also interesting to note is the limited usage data required
to perform these analyses.  The initial
user psychological testing period took approximately 3 hours, but accurate
results were obtained for only 30 minutes of computer usage.  In addition, the three hours of testing were
completely lost time – the users were able to work only on the tests during
this time.  In contrast, the 30 minutes
of analysis can be done on whatever the user is working on at the time.  No downtime is required to perform these
analyses.  We believe this system could
be useful anywhere a non-intrusive analysis of a user might be beneficial (e.g. determining whether a potential
employee would be a good fit).</p>
  <p xmlns="">For future work, we intend to focus on reducing the amount
of data needed even further.  Preliminary
results on as little as 500 characters (about 15 minutes of usage time) have
been promising.  Additional work is also
being done to integrate these methods into the broader active authentication
system in order to bolster the overall reliability of the system.</p>
