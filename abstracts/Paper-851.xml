  <p xmlns="">By conservative estimates, several hundred thousand poems appeared in early American and
U.S. newspapers from the eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries. Counting snippets of
verse that appeared in death notices, advertisements, and articles makes the presence of poetry in
historic newspapers even more pervasive. Feminist scholars and others performing recovery
work routinely resurrect authors and works from newspaper pages, but until recently this rich
trove of newspaper verse as a corpus of its own has been outside the scope of literary study and a
footnote in histories of American newspapers. In the last decade, however, scholars have made
significant inroads in studying the importance of newspaper verse as a form and the public role
of poetry in American culture. Underpinning this scholarship is a growing recognition that the
evaluation and history of American poetry should not be based on less than one percent of the
poetic record. In addition, this new scholarship values and explores the role of poetry in the daily
lives of people, including making sense of what it means to be human and in processing national,
social, and individual experiences. To the extent that these new histories depend on traditional
methods of archival discovery and analysis, however, they will remain anecdotal—individual
narratives extrapolated from a miniscule subset of the whole, with limited means of situating the
anecdote as either representative or idiosyncratic. In short, the magnitude of the corpus requires
new modes of discovery and analysis.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">A fundamental problem in the reappraisal of newspaper verse has been finding and
processing poetic content in an efficient manner, which is essential for developing new
interpretations, analyses, and literary histories. The primary means of finding this content
typically involves paging through original issues of newspapers, scrolling through reels of
microfilm, and browsing digital images to scan, by human eye, each page for graphical features
that resemble poetry. Dealing with only daily newspapers for a single year, 1860, would require
visually scanning nearly half a million newspaper pages. Certainly no individual in a lifetime
could complete a count—to say nothing of a comprehensive bibliography or macro-level
analysis—of newspaper verse using this strategy.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">While the digitization of historic newspapers has mitigated some issues of access, the
main avenues for discovery in these collections are browsing and text-based searching. Browsing
for poetic content in such collections follows the strategy outlined above: going image by image
through digitized pages and visually scanning the images for features typical of printed poetry.
Ironically, web interfaces and variations in Internet connection speeds can make digitally paging
through a newspaper a slower process than either scrolling through microfilm or flipping
physical pages.
</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>How, then, might one discover poetic content in digitized historic newspapers?</em> Our
research shows that digital page images hold significant promise for scholarly inquiry with
regard to poetic content. The basis for our approach is that the appearance of poetic content
usually follows certain patterns that can be visually differentiated from other published texts in
newspapers. Given a newspaper page, a person can survey the page and figure out quickly
whether it contains a poem, to a certain degree of accuracy, without having to read or understand
the text. Our project has the computer do the same visual processing as the human eye and brain
when a person moves through a newspaper issue looking for poetic content. This image
processing approach can also be used as a powerful filter, removing materials from further
consideration that do not meet the specified criteria. That is, not only does the process work to
identify pages that appear to include poetry, but it discards those that do not, weeding out much
of the noise.
</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Methodology
</h2>
  <p xmlns="">The image processing component of the project consisted of two important phases: training and
deployment. During the training phase, the goal was to produce a classifier able to categorize an
image as either a poem or non-poem image. To produce the classifier, a training dataset was
prepared and fed into a machine learning-based classifier. After the classifier was produced, we
moved to the deployment phase. During this phase, the steps used to prepare the training sets
were streamlined to automatically process and classify new images. In this paper, we focus on
the four stages of the training phase: (1) pre-processing, (2) feature extraction, (2) neural
networks learning, and (4) testing.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">The first stage involved manual extraction of image snippets from digitized newspapers.
For training, we developed three sets of snippets: (1) at least part of a poem appears in the
snippet, (2) the snippet contains no poetic content, and (3) the snippet has visual cues that are
similar to poetic content. Because each snippet is inherently noisy and could be of low quality,
we performed 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 averaging to smooth out noisy pixels, a step known as blurring.
To convert the blurred snippet into a binary image—effectively identifying the object pixels
from background pixels—we used a bi-Gaussian (or bi-normal) curve approximation
(Haverkamp et al., 1995) to obtain the binary segmentation threshold. (See Figure 1 and Figure
2.)</p>

    </figcaption>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="">After obtaining binary images, the next task was representing and extracting visual cues
as salient features. We evaluated three sets of attributes: (1) the left and right margins (number of
columns without a dark pixel); (2) the vertical white spacing between adjacent lines of text
(mean and standard deviation); (3) the jaggedness of the ends-of-lines for poetic content (mean
and standard deviation).
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Then, with this imagery data re-represented as numeric data, we used machine learning
techniques to train a classifier. Specifically, we used the machine learning approach known as
artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Hopfield, 1988; Yegnanarayana, 2009). An ANN learns a
vector of weights on features in the dataset to choose labels for new data. Such a network
consists of multiple nodes connected to threshold functions or additional layers of nodes. The
network is updated iteratively until it correctly predicts labels for training data. We used a back-
propagation ANN (Hecht-Nielsen, 1989) where weights connecting the nodes update iteratively
based on how the network classifies known data points in the training dataset—whether its
classification matches the labels of training data points.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Back-propagation ANNs have two phases. During phase 1, a training instance or data
point is fed into the ANN’s multi-layer structure, generating activations in the nodes and
resulting in a final output label. During phase 2, "rewards" are propagated back to the input layer
from the output layer based on whether the final output label matches the ground-truth label of
the instance. If the output label is correct, all the linkages within the structure contributing to the
correct output are rewarded with an increased weight. If the output label is incorrect, all
contributing linkages are penalized accordingly with a reduced weight. In this manner, the
network learns incrementally to find a combination of weights for these links.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">Finally, to validate the accuracy of the classifier, a ten-fold cross validation process was
used. In this process, the total data set was broken into ten groups. The classifier was trained
using nine of the groups and then tested on the single remaining set. This process of training and
testing was repeated until each group had been used as the test set once. The results were then
aggregated and the accuracy computed.
</p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Findings
</h2>
  <p xmlns="">In addition to discussing the importance of newspapers and newspaper verse for American
literary history and the need for new modes of discovery in digitized collections, this paper will
report on three results of our research: (1) basic analysis, (2) training and classification analysis,
and (3) a comparative study. The basic analysis will present the algorithms we used to extract
visual features from the snippets, and the correlation analyses we did to ascertain the feasibility
of our image-based approach. This will show the potential discrimination power of our visual
features in distinguishing poem or non-poem snippets. The training and classification analysis
will document our experimentation with different ANN configurations and report on our training
processes. This will include the number of hidden nodes in our ANNs used, learning weights and
momentum parameters investigated, convergence rates of the different configurations, and
training and classification accuracies. Finally, we will report on our comparative study in terms
of the usefulness of our blurring processes and how better to fuse them. In particular, we will
show whether submitting each image as a single data point with three sets of attributes or
submitting each blurred image with its set of attributes as a single data point leads to more
effective training and higher classification accuracy.
