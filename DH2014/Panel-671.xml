  <p xmlns="">In A Companion to Digital Humanities<cite href="#n1">1</cite>, Willard McCarty cites Nelson Goodman in saying that the term 'model' can be used to denote "almost anything from a naked blonde to a quadratic equation". Indeed the terms 'model' and 'modeling' seem almost painfully polysemous. Nevertheless within Digital Humanities we cannot ignore the terms or the concepts behind them—the notions are inextricably linked to what is one of the core objectives of humanities computing<cite href="#n2">2</cite>, namely to render humanities data computationally tractable<cite href="#n3">3</cite> and processable<cite href="#n4">4</cite><cite href="#n5">5</cite> to enhance our abilities for analysis. </p>
  <p xmlns="">In light of the renewed debate on modeling in Digital Humanities<cite href="#n6">6</cite> this panel proposes to investigate how humanists currently understand the role and meaning of modeling, and how we may arrive at an understanding of the term appropriate for humanities research and pedagogy.</p>
  <p xmlns="">McCarty stated a decade ago that the humanities lack a disciplined way of talking about modeling<cite href="#n7">7</cite> which makes it extremely difficult to define the properties and uses of appropriate models for humanities research. Modeling is a commonplace implicit activity in digital humanities, yet our modeling activities are almost never explicitly discussed as such, and it is rarely pointed out that many of our results are in fact models: charts, probabilistic methods, interfaces to the information we structure in databases. This implicitness is attested by our language use. We do not speak of "modeling an analogy" or of "modeling a chart". We "make" or "create" them as concrete representations of an implicit and abstract model.</p>
  <p xmlns="">Yet, given the concrete applications and results that can already be seen within the humanities, modeling needs to be a humanities praxis to the same extent as it already is in other scientific fields such as biology and physics. As the social sciences –more specifically the ethnography practices in Science &amp; Technology Studies for instance– show us, praxis by definition can be studied and interrogated for its properties by observing and following its practitioners<cite href="#n8">8</cite>. This panel provides a first step in such observant interrogation. </p>
  <p xmlns="">In the computational domain modeling can be delineated in a narrow mathematical sense where model theory<cite href="#n9">9</cite> defines Turing complete languages as models or instantiations of logic constructed from formulas (i.e. syntax or rules) and signatures (i.e. vocabulary or objects). Thus, computer languages are themselves mathematical models of logic. They provide a layer of expressive logic that in turn allows us to compositionally model data, objects and their relations<cite href="#n10">10</cite>. Analogous to the statement made by Peter Robinson about interfaces<cite href="#n11">11</cite>, we can argue that such a composition or model expresses an intellectual argument about the real world entities and relations they mimic, capture, or simulate—an intellectual argument that is made on several levels through the computational model and that eventually is communicated to an observer (or user) by way of its interface.</p>
  <p xmlns="">In recent years we find most notably the application of modeling in order to create maps, graphs, trees<cite href="#n12">12</cite><cite href="#n13">13</cite>, analogies, diagrams, charts, simulations<cite href="#n14">14</cite>, and stylometric analyses<cite href="#n15">15</cite>, as well as in discourse analysis, topic modeling, and narrative modeling<cite href="#n16">16</cite>. If the successful computational analytical models are quantitatively and statistically founded, does that mean that humanities modeling must necessarily be anchored in the somewhat narrowly defined models that are generally associated with quantification and computer science</p>
  <p xmlns="">More generally, must the concepts of ‘model’ and ‘modeling’ appropriate for Digital Humanities be bound solely by parameters of the mathematical foundations of binary logic? Modeling as activity and concept applies more widely to the humanities than merely in its computational applications. Is it possible to turn around the dynamic of the computational 'stack', so that rather than having mathematics drive humanities computability, the properties of humanistic problems and the data behind them might drive models of computation? We can argue that the goal of any computational approach within the humanities is to render computable the complexity, the abstraction, the ambiguity, the subjectivity, and multiplicity of perspective of the humanities<cite href="#n17">17</cite>. Similarly: how do we encompass aspects of modeling present in simulation and (serious) gaming<cite href="#n18">18</cite> of which the humanistic aspects seem to transcend the narrow mathematical connotation of ‘model’? And how does modeling relate to the continuing history of developing and redeveloping digital humanities tools that–rather than merely representing infrastructure–creates a record of intellectual theorizing humanistic computational models?<cite href="#n19">19</cite> How do we break out of the mathematical sandbox defined by first-order logic to do justice to the modalities of humanities? Does this require completely new models for data, logic, and representation? Does it require a general theory of modeling? Even a new symbolic language inspired by the humanities?</p>
  <p xmlns="">This panel brings together some of the most visible practitioners of computational methods within the humanities who have captured analytic models in software code, as well as some of the most influential figures of what might be called 'tacit modeling theory in digital humanities'. We invite them to consider the characteristics of humanities modeling and how those contrast with computational modeling and mathematical modeling, so as to determine what idiosyncrasies modeling might have in a humanities domain. Do these idiosyncrasies allow us to delineate a computationally tractable vocabulary at all? To investigate these questions the panel will discuss and reflect on matters such as…</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li>How do we address the role of modeling and models in the humanities?</li>
    <li>How do we ensure that existing mathematical logic does not confine our ability to represent and manipulate humanistic evidence?</li>
    <li>What benefits does a definition of modeling appropriated for the humanities hold?</li>
    <li>What would a symbolic language for the humanities look like?</li>
    <li>What are the standards of evaluation in modeling and do we need specific ones in the Humanities?</li>
    <li>What is a useful vocabulary to talk about modeling in a humanities sense?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 xmlns="">Panelists</h2>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Joris van Zundert</em> (Chair) is in charge of methodological research at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands. Next to his research in computational humanities he is interested in exchanges between digital humanities and science and technology studies (STS).</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Tara L. Andrews</em> has implemented a digital workbench for the fully computational stemmatic analysis of text traditions (http://www.digitalbyzantinist.org/2012/09/announcing-stemmaweb.html). As an assistant professor of digital humanities she is currently developing and teaching a curriculum that emphasizes modeling and algorithmic approaches to humanistic analysis</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Johanna Drucker</em> vehemently called attention to the properties of humanities data that are normally neglected by mathematical and conventional computational models and analyses. She has argued that all data are in fact capta and that naïve approaches to statistics are at risk of defining all data as intrinsically quantitative</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Fotis Jannidis</em> is developing a white paper on modeling in digital humanities, a version of which will be included in the new edition of the Companion to Digital Humanities. He is a  member of the TEI consortium–most notably as the Chair of the Genetic Edition Encoding Special Interest Group. TEI can be designated the only de facto standard for text structure modeling and encoding</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Mike Kestemont</em> specializes in stylometry and together with the Computational Stylistics Group (https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/home) has developed "Stylo", a software package in the R statistical programming language. He is an expert of statistical models expressed through computer algorithms and applied to literature stud</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Geoffrey Rockwell</em> conceptualized a number of highly visible tools for text analyses (e.g. Voyant: http://voyant-tools.org). He is finalizing a book demonstrating amongst others how the hermeneutic and theoretical aspects of text analysis models in the form of tool development transcends mere IT mathematics and infrastructure.</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Michael Sperberg-McQueen</em> is a markup specialist by profession and was co-editor of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) specification, chair of the XML Schema working group, as well as heavily involved with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</p>
  <p xmlns=""><em>Ted Underwood</em> works at the interface of literary history and machine learning and is particularly interested in using Bayesian statistics to develop models that reason about uncertainty in a principled way. He maintains an influential blog on his experiences in computational humanities (http://tedunderwood.com/).  </p>
  <h2 xmlns="">Organization of the panel</h2>
  <p xmlns="">The primary selection criterion for the panelists is their expertise, but care has been taken to balance the panel as much as possible for age, gender, field, and region. The panel session will be organized as follows</p>
  <ul xmlns="">
    <li>The Chair will introduce the panel’s topic, discussion questions, and the panelists (10 minutes); </li>
    <li>Each of the panelists will give a definition of modeling as a 1 minute provocative pitch (10 minutes); </li>
    <li>An open forum between the panelists and the audience follows (60 minutes); </li>
    <li>A circular setting of seats with panelists distributed among the attendees will be used to enhance audience participation in the discussion;</li>
    <li>The panel discussion will be audio recorded, concise conclusions will be published to the web.</li>
  </ul>
