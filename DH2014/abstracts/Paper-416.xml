  <p xmlns="">High-resolution page images are providing digital humanities
researchers with unprecedented visual access to historically significant works
located around the world. As libraries and archives continue digitizing their historical document collections, they are increasing
the quality and resolution of their document imaging systems and producing
images that, while unprecedented in their clarity and detail, are inconvenient
to navigate and manipulate in traditional browser-based environments. Users find themselves waiting for large PDF files to download, or
clicking endlessly through thumbnail after thumbnail to find a page image that contains materials of interest to them. These methods of document navigation and viewing
have been in place since the infancy of the web browser, and are needlessly awkward
given advances in creating asynchronous web applications.</p>
  <p xmlns="">The most common interface paradigm for browsing images
online is the ‘image gallery’. To illustrate this type of interface we will use the example of the Early English Books Online
(EEBO) interface as one with which some readers may be familiar. In the EEBO image viewing interface, users navigate a document as if it were a series of independent images, or image gallery, viewing small thumbnails that, while efficient for downloading to a browser, make it impossible to see the actual content of the page (Figure 1). To examine any single page, the user must click on an image, bringing up a second view of the page
optimized for viewing in the browser, but may not be usable for close examination if the text on the
page is too small. Should a user wish to examine any part of a page in particular detail, there may be an option to download a larger,
high-resolution image, but the user must wait for this large image to download to their browser, which may take several minutes depending on the speed of the network connection and the size of the image. If the user waits for the full quality image to download but wishes to continue browsing the document on the next page they
must traverse back to the smaller thumbnails and start the process again.</p>

  <p xmlns="">An alternative to the image gallery mode of interaction is the use of a browser-based book reader component. Several of these systems are available for managing user interactions with page images. Perhaps the most well-known purpose-built web-based document
viewer is BookReader by the Internet ArchiveI<cite href="#n1">1</cite>. Developed as part of the Open
Library project, this software presents the user with a book metaphor, inviting
them to 'turn' the pages of a book. While this provides a useful alternative to the image gallery mode of viewing, the IA BookReader requires that each page is represented by a complete image file, so zooming in and viewing a page in detail requires the
user to wait while the entire image is downloaded—which can be slow and
cumbersome depending on the size and resolution of each image. This is also
true for PDF-based document image display, where a user is forced to accept a
trade-off between viewing low-resolution versions of page images, or waiting
for extremely large PDF files to download before they can view any of the
pages. </p>
  <p xmlns="">To optimize viewing large, high-resolution documents in a web browser we developed the Diva document image viewer. Diva features several methods for managing user interactions with document page images. Users interact with the full document by scrolling the document, as they might with a PDF file. However, in Diva all page images are composed of smaller tiles. These tiles are of
a fixed size (256x256 pixels), and all pages (and their tiles) that are outside of the user's
viewport are not downloaded to the browser. This creates an ‘instant-on’ effect to viewing a
document, since the user does not have to wait for the entire document to download, but just a small portion. As a
user scrolls, new tiles are downloaded on-demand. To view higher or lower resolution page images, users can 'zoom' between resolutions. Zooming in and out on an
image will download just the portion of the page that fits on the users’
screen (Figures 2 and 3).</p>

  <p xmlns="">With the ubiquity of mobile devices it is important to ensure Diva functions on low-memory systems, like the iPad or iPhone. Diva.js uses several methods unique to document image viewers for optimizing memory usage and display. While a document may be several hundred pages long, Diva keeps just three pages in memory at any given point in time, dynamically adding and removing page elements from the browser as the user scrolls. This creates a fast and efficient browsing system for both mobile and desktop devices.  </p>
  <p xmlns="">Furthermore we have built a number of image manipulation tools
into Diva.js that allow users to engage with a document. Many documents,
especially older manuscripts, feature faded inks or text that is written
perpendicular to the captured page orientation (e.g., marginalia). Using Diva,
users can manipulate brightness, contrast, and page rotation in their browser
via an unique set of HTML5-based image manipulation tools, allowing them to
enhance faded inks or rotate a page to read margin notes or tables (Figure 4). Other
viewers that offer this functionality manipulate the image on the server and
then send it back to the client. This is a high-latency operation. With browser-based
image manipulation users can see the results of their changes immediately.</p>

  </div>
  <p xmlns="">  We have used Diva.js as the presentation layer of a document
image search system. When a user searches for a given word or phrase, the
results are presented in situ on page
images, highlighting the exact location on each page where their result occurs.
</p>
  <p xmlns="">All components of Diva are available as free and open-source
software, available on GitHub <cite href="#n2">2</cite>. Diva may be integrated into existing digital library systems. On the server-side, Diva requires the
IIP Image Server <cite href="#n3">3</cite>, a giga-pixel image server that serves the page image tiles, and
a standard web server, such as Apache or NginX. Document images can be encoded as either multi-resolution JPEG2000, or pyramid TIFF files. The JavaScript
components of Diva.js will work in any modern web browser. These components
manage the asynchronous communication process between the user's browser, the web server, and the IIP Image Server. We have also built in a comprehensive API and plugin system that provides ‘hooks’ into the page loading and image manipulation systems.</p>
  <p xmlns="">In our presentation we will provide a
demonstration of Diva.js and an overview of its background and development
history. We will discuss several case studies where we have employed Diva.js
for viewing and searching large historical document image collections, where it
is used to display page images captured at over 1,200 PPI. Zooming in on images
at these resolutions allow users to view individual brush strokes, paper detail
and condition, to view details of manuscript illuminations, and several other
important document factors that are lost in lower-resolution image displays.
Finally we will demonstrate several new features for highlighting and
annotating places of interest on page images and integrating page images with the
output of optical character recognition software.</p>
