This relationship is especially profound as the library community is becoming increasingly more aware and concerned about creating opportunities for librarians to develop more skills and opportunities for training in the technical, prestige-laden skillsets. One of the goals of this group is to encourage and develop training projects in digital scholarship for library staff. Digital Humanities, and more generally digital scholarship, re-skilling and training opportunities provide librarians hands-on experiences with the skills and tools needed to create digital humanities projects, their existing skills are enriched, they are challenged to become fluent in less familiar areas, and most importantly they are empowered to become true partners in this field of scholarship--rather than simply purveyors of content. Furthermore, these efforts of growing sustainable DH initiatives within libraries help to ensure the long-term survival of digital humanities.</p><p xmlns="">This one-day workshop is an opportunity for digital humanists working with/in libraries to come together to learn from one another about current international efforts for training library staff to acquire digital skills relevant to emerging digital research and scholarship practice. The goal of this workshop is that participants will be able to systematically design an approach that works specifically for their home libraries, propose their approach successfully to library leadership, and come together as a community of practice to support future re-skilling initiatives.</p><p xmlns="">In order to achieve these objectives, this workshop will begin with a panel-led discussion of five, international DH training initiatives for library staff. Although each of these initiatives have different foci and implementation methods, librarians with diverse backgrounds and the critical skills necessary to conceptualize, design, and implement digital initiatives are now vital members of teams able to create lasting digital projects both for library and scholarly use. Exposure to first-hand accounts of the development and implementation of these types of initiatives is vital before proceeding with initiative design because it will challenge participants’ notions of re-skilling within libraries and possibly inspire ideas for how to implement such strategies within their own organizations.</p><p xmlns="">The second half of the workshop will focus on leveraging the experiences and best practices shared by the morning panel in order to help each participant create their own strategic plan for a DH training initiative within their own library. This will be performed through an interactive exercise where participants will be walked through the design thinking process and then asked to work together to troubleshoot one another’s plans for clarity and execution. We will then come back together as a group to discuss how to take these plans and successfully pitch them to library leadership for implementation. The day will be concluded with a discussion of how the day’s efforts can be made more successful with the support of community: specifically the creation or integration of these many different and varied library staff education initiatives, that exist within specific institutional contexts, into a singular, sustainable community of practice for supporting efforts for empowering library staff to become more active collaborators in digital humanities.</p><h2 xmlns="">Target Audience</h2><p xmlns="">The target audience consists of digital humanists working with/in libraries who are interested in developing opportunities for re-skilling and training in digital scholarship for library staff.</p><p xmlns="">Participants are asked to prepare the following materials with them to the workshop:</p><ol xmlns=""><li>A chart or map of your library’s organizational structure;</li><li>A list of the needs of your library regarding digital humanities skills. This could be inspired by upcoming projects, recent initiatives outlined by library leadership, etc.</li><li>A list of five people within your own library who are experts in five different areas of digital scholarship. Participants are encouraged to think outside of the box regarding this. For example, is there someone in your metadata department that has experience in leveraging metadata standards? Do you have a phenomenal project manager working on digital library projects?</li></ol><h2 xmlns="">Workshop Leader Bios</h2><p xmlns=""><strong>James Baker</strong></p><p xmlns="">Curator, Digital Research</p><p xmlns="">The British Library</p><p xmlns="">James Baker is a Curator in the Digital Research team at the British Library, a group whose responsibilities include the delivery and development of the library's ongoing Digital Scholarship Training Programme.
