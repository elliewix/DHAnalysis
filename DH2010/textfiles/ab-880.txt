Computing technologies such as CADD, GIS or databases, are generally developed
                    with the aims of the producers of the built environment (architects, engineers,
                    urban planners etc.) in mind. These existing technologies tend to be adapted
                    uncomfortably for pedagogical and research purposes. The field of built
                    environment studies, which here refers to scholarly fields like architectural
                    history and urban history and not practical fields like architecture, is just
                    beginning to consider how computing technologies can be designed and employed
                    for analytical and scholarly ends. What would software designed by practitioners
                    of built environment studies with their aims in mind look like? Engaging with
                    this problem is not only an opportunity to imagine a new practical tool but also
                    to critically inquire into the aims of built environment studies and the
                    assumptions embedded into existing built environment computing technologies.
                    This paper presents the 
Medieval Delhi Humanities Computing
                        Research Collective
’s proposal for an interface design concept that is
                    the culmination of their attempts to analyse both their own research questions,
                    processes and the suitability of existing technological strategies from the
                    perspective of architectural and urban historians. 

           

                The Medieval Delhi Humanities Computing Research Collective
                
The Collective is a Canadian-led international team of historians and art and
                    architectural historians from leading research institutions in Canada, the
                    United Kingdom, India, and Japan with expertise in Medieval Delhi and humanities
                    computing initiatives. Formed in 2008, the Collective is a result of the
                    Medieval Delhi Humanities Computing Initiative funded by UBC Martha Piper
                    Research Grant (Jan. 2008 to Sept. 2009). The Collective first met as a group in
                    a workshop and planning session on April 2-3, 2009 in Victoria, established
                    institutional linkages, data sharing agreements, and a common data repository,
                    and is working together to attract additional funding. The Collective is
                    currently completing its work on conceptualizing researcher oriented
                    technologies and strategies for architectural and urban historical research of
                    Medieval Delhi.

            

            

                Imagining Data Collages
                
Researchers interested in studying the built environment in a systematic way
                    typically need to reconcile diverse forms of data – spatial, textual, and visual
                    – and increasingly computing technologies are vital not only for storing and
                    retrieving this information but for analyzing it as well. To be able to research
                    built environments effectively then, a researcher-oriented digital interface and
                    infrastructure becomes increasingly necessary. Not only does one need to need to
                    build an array of databases of historical texts in multiple languages,
                    chronologically organized photographs, maps and satellite data and other forms
                    of information, but one needs to figure out simple productive ways to connect
                    and interface with these various databases, integrate them with large-scale
                    databases and design overlaying analytical tools that truly facilitate
                    historical inquiry and collective scholarship. If planning officials,
                    architects, tourism industries and others increasingly develop and use computing
                    technologies with their goals in mind why should not the built environment
                    scholarly community?

                
The Collective’s approach treats architectural sites and urban form as a
                    collection of visual and textual representations of varying precision across
                    time and space each with their own interpretable contexts. For example, a site
                    is not viewed as entirely knowable in its moment of creation but as something
                    that evolves in form and memory and can be known only through its various
                    representations whether they be the textual account of a 12th C court historian,
                    the textual and pictorial accounts of a 19th C British traveller, the textual
                    and photographic records of a 20th C Japanese archaeological team, the oral and
                    videographic account of an Indian tourist from Mumbai, or a 21st century
                    satellite image. These representations amount to a collage of data hence the
                    term Data Collage. While this approach is familiar to researchers of
                    architectural and urban history it is generally not incorporated into existing
                    technology strategies which tend to favour virtual reconstructions or presume
                    the stability of knowledge and a uniform level of precision for spatial and
                    chronological information. This representational approach has important
                    implications for how data should be structured and engaged with.

                
Instead of attempting to recreate a historic architectural site or region as
                    virtual reality, Data Collages treat an architectural site or region as a
                    collection of intersecting and conflicting representations. Ideally, a Data
                    Collage will allow researchers of an historic site to access all relevant
                    three-dimensional digital models, photographs, paintings and historical textual
                    descriptions in original and translated texts and be able to see how these
                    various representations are interrelated chronologically and spatially and where
                    they conflict.
