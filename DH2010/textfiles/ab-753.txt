Metadata that serve as semantic markup, such as conceptual categories that describe
                the macrostructure of a plot in terms of actors and their mutual relationships,
                actions, and their ingredients annotated in folk narratives, are important
                additional resources of digital humanities research. Traditionally originating in
                structural analysis, in fairy tales they are called functions (Propp, 1968), whereas
                in myths – mythemes (Lévi-Strauss, 1955); a related, overarching type of content
                metadata is a folklore motif (Uther, 2004; Jason, 2000). 

            
In his influential study, Propp treated a corpus of tales in Afanas'ev's
                collection (Afanas'ev, 1945), establishing basic recurrent units of the plot
                ('functions'), such as 
Villainy, Liquidation of
                    misfortune, Reward, 
or 
Test of Hero
, and the
                combinations and sequences of elements employed to arrange them into moves.
The
                    full list of functions is available at 
http://clover.slavic.pitt.edu/sam/propp/praxis/features.html

                His aim was to describe the DNA-like structure of the magic tale sub-genre as a
                novel way to provide comparisons. As a start along the way to developing a story
                grammar, the Proppian model is relatively straightforward to formalize for
                computational semantic annotation, analysis, and generation of fairy tales. Our
                study describes an effort towards creating a comprehensive XML markup of fairy tales
                following Propp's functions, by an approach that integrates functional text
                annotation with grammatical markup in order to be used across text types, genres and
                languages. 

            
The Proppian fairy tale Markup Language (PftML) (Malec, 2001) is an annotation scheme
                that enables narrative function segmentation, based on hierarchically ordered
                textual content objects. We propose to extend PftML so that the scheme would
                additionally rely on linguistic information for the segmentation of texts into
                Proppian functions. Textual variation is an important phenomenon in folklore, it is
                thus beneficial to explicitly represent linguistic elements in computational
                resources that draw on this genre; current international initiatives also actively
                promote and aim to technically facilitate such integrated and standardized
                linguistic resources. We describe why and how explicit representation of grammatical
                phenomena in literary models can provide interdisciplinary benefits for the digital
                humanities research community. 

            
In two related fields of activities, we address the above as part of our ongoing
                activities in the CLARIN
http://www.clarin.eu
 and AMICUS
http://ilk.uvt.nl/amicus
 projects. CLARIN aims to contribute
                to humanities research by creating and recommending effective workflows using
                natural language processing tools and digital resources in scenarios where
                text-based research is conducted by humanities or social sciences scholars. AMICUS
                is interested in motif identification, in order to gain insight into higher-order
                correlations of functions and other content units in texts from the cultural
                heritage and scientific discourse domains. We expect significant synergies from
                their interaction with the PftML prototype.

            

                Proppian fairy tale Markup Language (PftML)
                
Creating PftML was based on the insight that Propp's functions – organized
                    in tables to categorize his observations – were analogous to metadata, and as
                    such renderable by hierarchically arranged elements in eXtensible Markup
                    Language (XML) documents. A tale consists of one or more moves and on a lower
                    level of functions which are modeled as elements. Function elements themselves
                    have XML attributes that allow for the efficient extraction of data from the
                    text using XQuery from within a native XML database. The embedded structure of
                    Proppian functions as represented by PftML markup is illustrated in Fig. 1 by an
                    annotated excerpt from the English translation of the Russian fairy tale 
The Swan-Geese
. 

                
Note that Proppian functions are applied to relatively long, semantically
                    coarse-grained textual chunks, i.e. sentences, but linguistic elements that
                    convey a function actually encompass a shorter sequence of words; e.g. contrary
                    to the markup in the example, both 
Command
 and 
Execution
 only pertain to linguistic units smaller than
                    full sentences.

                Integration of PftML with linguistic annotation
                
We propose to combine PftML with a stand-off, multi-layered linguistic markup
                    scheme to ensure modularity and reusability of linguistic information associated
                    with textual elements, supporting interoperability of fairy tales annotation in
                    different languages and versions. As seen in Fig. 1, PftML is interleaving the
                    Proppian annotation with the text. This in-line annotation strategy has some
                    drawbacks: a text can hardly be annotated in fine-grained manner without losing
                    readability, or with information originating from different sources e.g.
                    indicating different views on narrative functions. 

                
Stand-off annotation strategy, following the standardization initiatives for
                    language resources conducted within ISO,
http://www.tc37sc4.org
 stores annotation separately from the original text, linking these by
                    referencing mechanisms. We adopt the ISO multi-layered annotation strategy,
                    representing linguistic information on the following levels: segmentation of the
                    text in tokens; morpho-syntactic properties of the tokens; phrasal
                    constituencies; grammatical dependencies; semantic relations (e.g. temporal,
                    co-referential), cf. (Ide and Romary, 2006). 

                
We illustrate how the linguistic annotation layers can be combined with the PftML
                    annotation in one stand-off annotation file, showing here only the
                    morphosyntactic and constituency annotation, as they are applied to the first
                    five tokens of the sub-sentence annotated with the 'Violated
                    Execution' function in Fig. 1. In the morphosyntactic annotation, the value
                    of the 
TokenID
 of the 12th word is pointing to the original data (e.g.,
                        
daughter
 is the 12th token in the text).
Note
                        that the original string is normally not present in these layers but is
                        displayed in annotation examples for readability's sake.

                

<wordForms>
    <W ID="w11" POS="ART" LEMMA="the" MORPH="Sg" tokenID="t11">the</W>
    <W ID="w12" POS="NN" LEMMA="daughter" MORPH="Sg" tokenID="t12">daughter</W>
    <W ID="w13" POS="ADV" LEMMA="soon" tokenID="t13">soon</W>
    <W ID="w14" POS="ADV" LEMMA="enough" tokenID="t14">enough</W>
    <W ID="w15" POS="VVFIN" LEMMA="forget" MORPH="Past" tokenID="t15">forgot</W>
    ... 
</wordForms>
                

                
In the constituency annotation level displayed below, words are grouped into
                    syntactic constituents (e.g. the nominal phrase 
the
                        daughter
). The span of constituents is marked by the value of the
                    features 
from
 and 
to
, which are pointing to the previous
                    morpho-syntactic annotation layer. 

                

<phrases>
    <phrase id="p4" from="w11" to="w12" type="NP">the daughter</phrase>
    <phrase id="p5" from="w13" to="w14" type="ADVP">soon enough</phrase>
    <phrase id="p6" from="w15" to="w15" type="VG">forgot</phrase>
    <phrase id="p7" from="w16" to="w20" type="REL_COMP">what they had told her
    </phrase> ... 
</phrases>
                

                
PftML and (for example) word-level annotation can be combined in one stand-off
                    XML element, where each specific PftML annotation receives a span of textual
                    segments associated with it: 

                

<Execution subtype="Violated" id="e1" inv_id="Command1" from="w11" to="w21"> </Execution>
                

                
The values 
w11
 and 
w21
 are used for defining a region of the
                    text for which the Propp function holds; 
Command1
 refers to the 
Interdiction
 function label used earlier in the
                        text.
We started to implement this work within the D-SPIN project (see
                            
http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/dspin
), which is
                        the German complementary project to CLARIN.

            

            

                Benefits for humanities research
                
The integrated annotation scheme enables narrative segmentation enhanced by
                    additional information about the linguistic entities that constitute a given
                    function. A folklore researcher might be interested in which natural language
                    expressions correspond to which narrative function: in the <
Execution subtype="Violated"
> example, 
forgot
 can be an indicator of this function. In fact, it is also
                    relevant to signal that 
forgot
 is a verb, and to reduce
                    the strings 
forgets, forgot, forgotten
 to one lemma (i.e.
                    base form), so that all morphological forms are retrieved when any of these
                    variants is queried.

                
Navigating through the different types of IDs included in the multilayered
                    annotation, a researcher can obtain statistics over linguistic properties of
                    fairy tales. For example, the grammatical subject of a function can be
                    extracted, e.g. to see which characters participate in commands and their
                    violation. Note that if – according to the current scheme – the narrative
                    function boundaries are imprecise, the <
Execution
                        subtype="Violated"
> function in our example sentence would
                    incorrectly contain two grammatical – and three semantic – subjects (
father and mother
, and 
daughter
). 

                
Linguistic information will enable detecting functions that refer to each other,
                    as syntax and semantics of sentence pairs in such relations mirror – at least
                    partly – each other, e.g. 
Don't go out of the yard

                        and
 ran onto the street
. Detecting cross-reference in
                    turn contributes to identifying a function's core elements, which is a
                    crucial step in understanding the linguistic vehicles by which motifs operate
                    and the degree of variation and optionality they allow. 

            

            

                Concluding remarks
                
Since the content descriptors in PftML might pertain to textual material on the
                    supra- or subsentential level, there is a need to investigate the mechanisms
                    underlying the assignment of a function to a span of words. We propose to tackle
                    this issue based on linguistic analysis, hypothesizing that boundaries of
                    certain linguistic objects overlap with boundaries of Proppian functions. A
                    direct consequence of more precise segmentation of functions is that linguistic
                    characterization, retrieval, and further computational processing of texts from
                    the folktale genre will improve, and facilitate detecting higher-level,
                    domain-specific cognitive phenomena. It would also become feasible to detect
                    from corpus evidence if there exist additional functions beyond Propp's
                    scheme. 

                
Integration along the above lines with ontological resources of fairy tales is
                    described in a separate study by us (Lendvai et al., 2010). We expect from our
                    strategy – applied to tales in different versions in different languages – to
                    lead to the generation of a multilingual ontology of folktale content
                    descriptors, which would be extending the efforts of the MONNET
                        project,
Multilingual ONtologies for NETworked Knowledge, see 
http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/languagetechnologies/project-monnet_en.html
 originally focussing on financial and governmental issues. In future
                    work we plan to address embedding our annotation work into the TEI framework,
http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml
 and extend
                    the ISO strategy on using well-defined data categories for linguistic annotation
                        labels
see 
http://www.isocat.org/
 to those of
                    functions corresponding to PftML labels, to facilitate porting our approach to
                    other literary genres.
