    
I. Introduction
    
    
This study aims to focus on 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 (“An Old letter scrapbook”; 1696), a collection of posthumous works in the early modern Japanese genre of 
Ukiyozoushi
浮世草子
, written by Saikaku Ihara 
井原西鶴
 (1642?–1693) as a classical, foundational document of Japanese culture; then it will examine the “authorship problem” in Saikaku’s works using the tools of quantitative analysis.

    
In contrast to so-called scholarly books with named authors, graphic novels or storybooks called 
soushi
草子
(realistic literature), were generally anonymous in this era. The earliest work generally acknowledged as 
Ukiyozoushi
浮世草子
, and thus the first Japanese early modern novel, emerges with the publication of Saikaku's 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
 (“The life of an amorous man”; 1682) (Munemasa 1969), but there are almost no attributed (signed) works among the 23 
Ukiyozoushi
浮世草子
 considered to be Saikaku’s. While work on Saikaku has proceeded, these fundamental doubts about his authorship remain.

    
Meanwhile, the potential of quantitative analysis of textual data and the related field of the digital humanities have also dramatically advanced. However, quantitative analysis of Japanese classical works has lagged behind. Delayed digitalization of classical works has been a problem due to complications regarding development of morphological analysis software for classical works. At this moment, adequate morphological analysis software for early modern Japanese literature does not yet exist.

    
Five Saikaku's collections of posthumous works were edited and published from 1693 to 1699 by followers of the author including Dansui Houjou 
北条団水
, on the basis of unpublished drafts considered by them to have been Saikaku’s. As a result, some doubt arose subsequently about the authorship and publication history of these works.

    
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 was published as the fourth such collection of posthumous works, in the third year after the death of Saikaku (1696). This work is a collection of epistolary novels, consisting of 17 chapters each telling a different short story. The next section considers the doubts about Saikaku’s authorship.






II. Previous Studies    






A. Doubts raised by Yamaguchi
Yamaguchi (1929) mentions that 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 may be an apocryphal work actually written by Dansui, for the following reasons.
        

1. While the handwriting is similar to Saikaku’s, the lines are bolder and there is a slight lack of roundness due to the powerful strokes.
2. Unlike in the other posthumous publications, Dansui did not provide a preface to 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
.
3. The publishers of 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 are the same as those for 
Saikaku oridome
西鶴織留
, the unfinished second collection. There is doubt as to why they chose to publish 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
, later than 
Saikaku oridome
西鶴織留
 although it was in more complete form.
4. While it seems clear that some of the work was written by Saikaku, some chapters seem to have been rewritten by Dansui to impose an epistolary form and remove some descriptive passages. It is considered that these intrusions are less elegantly composed.







B. Arguments for Saikaku's scholarship
Teruoka (1953) thinks that the handwriting is similar to Saikaku’s, but notes that even if this is not the case, it does not prove that Saikaku did not write the actual text, which he feels exhibits clear ideological commonalities with Saikaku’s other work. In addition, Taniwaki (1981) raises various doubts but ultimately assumes that all 17 chapters were written by Saikaku since the inventive ideas would have been beyond the range of his imitators.







C. New doubts raised by Nakamura
Nakamura (1982) mentions Yamaguchi’s concerns regarding the handwriting, concluding that the handwriting likely belongs to the author of 
Tanba Taro monogatari
丹波太郎物語
 (“The story of Tanba Taro”), not Saikaku.

    
On the basis of similar arguments, Nakamura actually makes an argument for the identities of the authors of each chapter.

    
The existence/non-existence of the later insertions to the book has not yet been settled. For that reason, this study re-examines the text of 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 using a quantitative approach.



    
 

III. Database of Saikaku's Works   
     
     
Table I shows part of the 578,617-word database used for
this analysis (beginning with 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
). We morphologically 
analyzed all of Saikaku's 23 works. This database is the only one on Saikaku’s works at present
and has a high degree of reliability.

IV. Analysis    
    
    
In general, Saikaku’s works are made up of many short
stories(chapters). We used information of each chapter in our
analysis. Then, we compared 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文
反古
 to 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
, as an authenticated
work of Saikaku.

    

Figure I. 
Boxplot (the top six most common classes)
The basic analysis considers appearance ratio of words by
grammatical class, using the top six most common classes:
nouns, particles, (main) verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs for appearance ratio were used in the analysis.

    
Figure 1 is a boxplot depicting the appearance ratio of
these items in both works. We found differences among verbs
and particles only.

    
Furthermore, we examined by welch’s t-test at the 0.05
significance level. It concluded that in 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 and 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
 of verbs and
particles using way is different.

    
Figure II represents the results of the analysis on
appearance rate, using principal component analysis (PCA)
with a correlation matrix. The horizontal axis shows the
importance of first principal component and the vertical axis,
the second. Proportion of variance the first principal
component is 0.34, while the second is 0.29; the cumulative
prpportion up to the second principal component is 0.64.

    

Figure II. 
PCA results for 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 and 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
 (the top six most common classes)
In Figure II, indicating differences revealed by PCA,

Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 is on the left and 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
 on the right.

    
Upon examining the principal component vector, we find
that verbs, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, attributes, and adjectives
affect in a positive direction, while particles and nouns affect
in a negative direction. (Table II).

    
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 showed a high
appearance ratio for verbs and nouns, while 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
showed a high appearance ratio for auxiliary verbs, particles, and adjectives (Table II). Therefore, it can be said that the appearance ratio of attached words is high in 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
 compared to that in 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
.

V. Conclusion    
    
      
In this study, two works attributed to Saikaku, 
Yorozu no humihougu
万の文反古
 and 
Kousyoku ichidai otoko
好色一代男
, were compared and analyzed for word class appearance ratios. Significant differences were found.

    
However, it can be argued that the content and date of each work written will influence word class appearance ratios. Thus, we need to consider this issue from other perspectives and using other data.
