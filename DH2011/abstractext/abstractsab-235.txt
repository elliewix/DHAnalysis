In the very early days of the world wide web, but well into a period in which our
            community understand the positive and transformative impact that computational technique
            has had on scholarly editing, Fortier reminded us that literary studies is and always
            has been focused on the study of texts regardless of interpretive theoretical
            predisposition. In digital literary studies, that textual focus manifests in a number of
            theories about the nature of the text in general and the electronic scholarly edition in
            particular, and has developed such that a basic typology of electronic scholarly
            editions is relatively straightforward to construct via the approach taken in handling
            textual materials. Well into what is often called the age of Web 2.0, it is worth noting
            that prominent types of electronic scholarly editions were largely developed before the
            ubiquity of the world wide web that we now enjoy and do not accurately reflect its
            current academic engagement. Indeed, given that we have now entered a new phase in the
               social formation of the web, we can no longer ignore the
            influence of new networks and connections on the scholarly digital edition. Our
            understanding of the electronic scholarly edition requires reconsideration in light of
            the collaborative potential of current and emerging digital technologies; put another
            way, we need to extend our typology in light of new models of edition production that
            embrace social networking and its commensurate toolkit. We propose that, while the
            digital medium is most certainly a productive space in which to analyse editions (as
            proposed by Hans Walter Gabler), the social incarnation of the digital edition allows us
            to refocus our systematic analysis of texts, thus furthering the
            reconfiguration of the hierarchy for reading both texts and editions.


         
 This working paper offers a new understanding of the historical underpinnings of the
            scholarly and digital editions, and envisions the possibilities of the scholarly social
            edition. It is generally accepted that there are several basic models for electronic
            editions of a scholarly nature, each put forward before the advent of the world wide web
            -- each demonstrating disparity within and among approaches in handling the text that
            lies at their centre. Using Unsworth’s scholarly primitives as a model for describing
            the set of activities common to humanities scholars, we have developed a functional
            definition for the strategies employed by expert readers: Analysis, Synthesis,
            Communication, and Dissemination. New methods of engagement are both social in nature
            and reflect the interrelated nature of these strategies: analysis and synthesis grow
            from communication that, in turn, affects dissemination, and so forth. Based on recent
            research concerning the reading strategies of expert or professional readers, and the
            current state of digital humanities scholarship, the next step in the development of the
            scholarly edition is one that reflects the importance of collaboration, incorporates
            contributions by its readers, and where the editor acts as a facilitator for user
            involvement rather than enjoying an unassailable final word. Our model of the social
            edition points to new methods of engagement in digital literary studies. The social
            edition embraces the collective (but without losing sight of the individual) and accepts
            that no edition is ever truly complete. 


         
Despite Stephen Nichols’s call to ‘dismantle the silo model of digital scholarship,’
            many digital editions, like print editions, continue to exist as self-contained units
            that do not encourage interaction with other resources. Instead we would argue that the
            social edition grows from Greg Crane‘s exhortation: ‘[w]e need to shift from lone
            editorials and monumental editions to editors as … editors, who coordinate contributions
            from many sources and oversee living editions.’ The movement toward social edition
            production has already begun, with projects such as EEBO interactions, ‘a social
            networking resource for Early English Books Online’ (
         (

)
   ) and George Mason University’s
            ‘Crowdsourcing Documentary Transcription: an Open Source Tool,’ (
         (
link
)
   ) which is described as ‘an open source tool that would
            allow scholars to contribute document transcriptions and research notes to digital
            archival projects, using the Papers of the War Department as a test case.’ These
            projects, among others, point to a growing need in the scholarly community to expand our
            knowledge communities using the social technologies at our disposal. With the
            understanding that we cannot prophesize the exact nature of the social edition at this
            current juncture, we do, however, wish to reiterate the importance of seeing the
            scholarly text as a process, and the initial, primary editor as a facilitator, rather
            than progenitor, of knowledge creation.
