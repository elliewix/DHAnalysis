Abstract

                
Maps are dense, complex information systems arranged spatially. While they share
                    similarities with other visual artifacts, their uniqueness as spatially arranged
                    visual information both allows for and demands special digital approaches to
                    understand and reuse their content. Georeferencing, vectorization, virtual
                    reality, image databases, and GIS-related tools all work to unite our eyes,
                    minds, and computers in new ways that can make historical maps more valuable and
                    accessible to humanists concerned with place and space over time. Rumsey will
                    explore the tools and techniques that have implications for the ways digital
                    humanists approach visual information.
